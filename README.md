## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (to be installed):
  - pandas

  - scikit-learn
  - Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student-Performance-Analysis.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open `Student Performance Analysis.ipynb`
4. Follow the notebook cells to understand the analysis process

## Analysis Components
The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Predictive modeling

## Results and Insights
Here, Decision Tree has the highest accuracy of 97%, Random Forest has 94%, and Logistic Regression has 50%.
Based on the study of private universities in Bangladesh, key insights reveal that machine learning models, particularly Decision Tree with 97.10% accuracy, are effective in predicting student academic performance. Factors positively influencing performance include SGPA, CGPA, attendance, study hours, and merit scholarships. Conversely, high social media usage and probation status show significant negative correlations with academic success. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing study habits and social media use while highlighting the potential for targeted interventions based on predictive modeling to improve student outcomes
